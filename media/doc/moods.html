<h1>Movement Moods</h1>
<p>

These cards describe in words the kind of overall mood or<br/>
movement that reigns over all other expressions. They are<br/>
deliberately kept very poetic, in order that you can interpret<br/>
them with your memories and your sensibility. It is important to<br/>
note that you do not always have the same mood/movement<br/>
mode, that your modes can be conflicting and that you have to<br/>
maintain your mode in spite of interference.
