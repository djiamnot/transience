<h2>Wait for "X" to play</h2>
<p>

These cards describe the point where you start to play after<br/>
having created a new composite page. It can happen that both<br/>
of you have stopped playing: In this case one should start<br/>
whenever s/he thinks it is right, and the other should follow the<br/>
card.
