<h2>Melos</h2>
<p>
These cards offer all the melos phrases you can use – either the whole line <br/>
or the shorter phrases cut-out by the brackets around the stave.
</p>
<p>
Each phrase consists of a minimum of three notes. The first, the last and one<br/>
or more of the middle notes can be considered “important”notes. (these notes <br/>
have fixed transients as explained on the appendix page) You can read each <br/>
phrase as often as you want, you can linger on each note or sequence as long <br/>
as it makes musical sense.
</p>
<p>
If your instructions in B are OFFPITCH the individual notes may be played <br/>
with microtonal variants, while keeping the general shape of the melos <br/>
phrase. Of course, each note can and often must be pitch-bent (according to D) <br/>
– but it should always be clear that you either start or end on one of the <br/>
pitches in your melos phrase. The koto can also play chords. In this case, <br/>
only one note of the chord will be pitch-bent.
