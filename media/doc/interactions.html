<h2>Recitation / Playing technique</h2>
<p>
These cards describe the way you as a duo interact with eachother. One of you is <br/>
the dotted line, the other the straight line (depending on who starts the interaction). <br/>
The lines do NOT describe melodic movements, just types of gesture (a jagged line is <br/>
more aggressive, a flowing line more organic, a straight line represents not a bordun <br/>
or no events, but just ANY kind of music that fits etc.).

</td><td><b>Accompany</b>: One plays in the background the other more in the <br/>
foreground. (Difference to trope: accompaniment can be more <br/>
flexible and include many different ways of playing)</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/2.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Conversation</b>: Both exchange that build upon each other each <br/>
keeping to their own mood, as in a real conversation <br/> 
(Difference to trade: the fragments are longer, difference to quarrel: <br/> 
the melodies fit to each other)
</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/3.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Destroy</b>: One creates a mood which the other radically destroys. <br/> 
Quietness destroys Joy, aggressiveness destroys harmony etc. <br/> 
Then the destroyer creates a mood that the other destroys and so on.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/4.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Echoes</b>: One tries to echo the other perfectly (pitches, rhythms <br/> 
etc.) This is not reall possible, because transients and sound <br/> 
qualities are different, but one can try. For the duration of <br/> 
this mode the follower does not play her/his Rhythms and Melos models.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/5.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Embellish</b>: One plays slowly and the other uses his pitches to <br/> 
ornament the other‚Äùs melody in much faster notes.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/6.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Parallel</b>: like echoes, only that you try to really do the same <br/> 
thing at the same time. An exercise in absolute attention and little <br/> 
signs. One of you again forgets about their own R and M models.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/7.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Quarrel</b>: create a musical chaos, deliberately avoiding any <br/> 
harmony or rhythmical coherence.
<br/>
<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/8.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Trade</b> (or b>Hoquetus</b>): Quick alternations of mini-phrases <br/>
(1-3 notes).
</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="media/interactions/9.png" alt="Crescendo" height=30 width=80 /> 
</td><td><b>Trope</b>: One player creates a bordun or a repetitive pattern on <br/>
which the other can improvise. Exchange roles.
