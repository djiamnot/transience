<h2>Duration</h2>
<p>
These cards describe how long you should play before you look<br/>
at X and take away the next cards. The duration is either<br/>
measured in phrases or in notes. This, of course, implies no<br/>
absolute duration: you can leave a lot of silence between notes<br/>
or phrases.
</p>
<p>
Also, one special rule applies to repetitions: repeated phrases or<br/>
notes are counted only once. Thus you can, for example,<br/>
explore one 5 note phrase in may different rhythms, or create a<br/>
repetitive pattern, if needed. This rule could for example be<br/>
used if one of you needs to stop and create a new page: the<br/>
other could coast along on a few notes until the other is read to<br/>
play again.
