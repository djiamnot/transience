<h2>Rhythms</h2>
<p>
These cards offer all rhythmical possibilities. The brackets around the line <br/>
cut-out the rhythmical phrases you can use. Each rhythmical phrase can be <br/>
repeated maximum 9 times. But you can also play the entire line, up to 9 <br/>
times. Rhythm lines come in two varieties: with note-stems and without.
</p>
<h3>RHYTHMS with STEMS</h3>
<p>
describe rhythms to a clear pulsation, which should also be audible as <br/>
organized rhythms. Of course, there is no overall tempo, nor the two of you <br/>
have an common tempo. The pulsation, therefore, is one you feel inside, <br/>
responding to the music you have played before and the Movement Mode that<br/>
is currently in force. You take this pulsation as q and play the rhythm <br/>
strictly to this pulse.</p> 
<h3>RHYTHMS without STEMS</h3>
<p>
Describe free-floating durational relationships: small notes are shorter <br/>
and less accented, big notes are longer and more accented â€“ but precisely <br/>
how long is a matter of feeling. An  underlying pulsation should not be <br/>
perceivable.
</p>
<p>
Thus the difference between the two rhythmical modes (pulsation and <br/>
free-floating) should be very clear to the listener.
